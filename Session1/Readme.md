## What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

**Channels** are similar kind of information or feature grouped or containerized together and given a name. For instance, all red color information will be grouped under red channel, all blue information will be grouped under blue channel, etc. We can divide an image into as many number of channels as we wish.

**Kernels** are the ones used to extract similar kind of information. Kernels are instrumental in deriving channel information. Kernels are also called as **Feature Extractors** or **Filters** or **3x3 matrix**.

 

 

## Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 Kernels?

3x3 kernels are mostly used because of equal division between left and right parts of the image. We could use 5x5, 7x7, etc but for **computational benefits**, 3x3 is preferred to the other odd sized kernels. 3x3 also leads to **less number of parameters** when compared to other odd sized kernels. Using 7x7 kernel once is equivalent to using 3x3 kernel 3 times (same receptive field of 7.) However, while using 7x7 kernel, the number of parameters are (7*7) = 49. But on using 3x3 kernel 3 times, the number of parameters are 3 * (3*3) = 27.

## How are kernels initialized?

Kernels are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution. Another method is glorot (or Xavier) initializer which samples from a distribution but truncates the values based on the kernel complexity. In glorot initialization, each weight is initialized with a small Gaussian value with mean = 0.0 and variance based on the fan-in and fan-out of the weight; fan-in is number of input nodes and fan_out is number of output/hidden nodes.

 

 

## What happens during the training of a DNN?

Kernels are randomly initialized. During the training process, the values are corrected by the backpropagation to make the model predict the expected results. When we use a batch of say 100 images out of total 1000 images, first a forward pass happens which predicts the output for each of the 100 images and then backpropagation kicks in for every batch to correct the kernel values to match the desired output. A forward pass and a backward pass together is called an iteration. When all the 1000 images are used for training, in this case 10 batches are executed, then an epoch is said to be completed.
